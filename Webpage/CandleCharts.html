        <h3>Understanding Chart Elements</h3>
        
        <h4>Candles</h4>
        <img src="images/Heikin_ashi.jpg" alt="Candlestick"/>
        <p>Candlestick Charts:</p>
        <p>In candlestick charts, each individual element is called a "candle." These candles visually represent the price movement of a financial instrument, such as a stock, over a specific time period, typically on a trading chart. They provide valuable information about the open, close, high, and low prices for that time period.</p>
        <p>The key components of a candle include the body, wicks or shadows, open price, and close price. Candles come in various colors and shapes, providing insights into bullish (upward) or bearish (downward) price movements. Candlestick patterns, which are combinations of multiple candles, are used by traders to analyze and predict price movements. Common candlestick patterns include the "doji," "hammer," "engulfing," and many more.</p>

        <h4>Lines</h4>
        <img src="images/Linechart.jpg" alt="Line"/>
        <p>Lines in Candlestick Charts:</p>
        <p>Lines in candlestick charts represent the continuous connection of closing prices over time, creating a line graph. Unlike candles, which provide detailed information about price movements within a specific time period, lines focus solely on the closing prices.</p>
        <p>Line charts are primarily used to identify and visualize overall trends in price movements. An ascending line indicates an uptrend (rising prices), while a descending line indicates a downtrend (falling prices). A horizontal line suggests a period of price consolidation with little or no significant trend. Line charts are often used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools to confirm trends and make trading decisions. Traders may switch between candlestick charts and line charts depending on their specific analysis needs and preferences.</p>
        
               
        <h4>Price Chart</h4>
        <img src="images/PriceChart.jpg" alt="Price Chart"/>
        <p>The price chart is the central element of a chart. It displays the historical price data of a financial instrument, with time represented on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. Traders use the price chart to analyze past price movements and make predictions about future trends.</p>
        
        <h4>Indicators</h4>
        <p>Indicators are tools applied to the price chart to provide additional insights into price movements. These can include moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and more. Traders use indicators to identify potential buy or sell signals and confirm trends.</p>
        
        <h4>Drawings and Annotations</h4>
        <p>Traders can draw trendlines, support and resistance levels, and various shapes and annotations directly on the chart to mark important price levels or patterns. These drawings help traders plan their entry and exit points.</p>
        
        <h4>Timeframes</h4>
        <p>Timeframes allow traders to view price data at different intervals, such as minutes, hours, days, or weeks. Shorter timeframes provide a detailed view of intraday movements, while longer timeframes show broader trends.</p>
