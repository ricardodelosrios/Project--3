                    The Bullish Engulfing Pattern is a powerful two-candlestick pattern that signals a reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It occurs when a small bearish candle is followed by a larger bullish candle that completely engulfs the previous candle's range. This pattern suggests that buying pressure has overwhelmed selling pressure, indicating potential bullish momentum.

                </br>
                    The Hammer is a single-candlestick pattern characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow. It forms after a price decline and signals a potential bullish reversal. The long lower shadow indicates that buyers have pushed the price up significantly from its lows, and it's often seen as a sign of strength.

                    The Doji is a single-candlestick pattern that represents market indecision. It occurs when the opening and closing prices are very close or the same, resulting in a small or non-existent body. A Doji can signal a potential reversal or continuation, depending on the preceding price action.
